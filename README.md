# KeyboardVisualizerVCUI
Razer Chroma and Corsair RGB Keyboard Spectrograph Visualizer for Windows with Visual C++ UI

Binary builds can be downloaded from the Release submodule

You must have the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 32-bit redistributable package installed to run this program.

# Settings

There are many settings you can tweak to make Keyboard Visualizer work with your audio setup and to personalize it to your liking.

    * Amplitude - How reactive the visualizer is to sound.  If it is not responding, or is responding with a low level,
                  increase this value.
    * Background Brightness - How bright the background layer is (0-100%)
    * Average Size - How many bars of input to combine, increase for a less detailed output that may look better on
                     devices with low LED counts.
    * Decay - How much of the previous value is retained from step to step.  Higher values make the visualizer less
              flickery but seem slower to react, while low values are fast and flickery.  (0-100%)
    * Delay - How many milliseconds to wait between each device update.  Lower values give a higher "frame rate"
              but can cause flicker or other issues on certain setups.
    * Normalization Offset - Adjusts amplitude of bass frequencies, increase if your song lacks bass and decrease if
                             your song is bass heavy
    * Normalization Scale - Amount to scale up each consecutive frequency bar over normalization offset, to amplify
                            higher frequencies.  Increase if the right side of the visualizer is low.
    * FFT Window Mode - Select between None, Hamming, Hanning, and Blackman windowing functions
                        (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function for the math behind FFT windowing)
    * Background Mode - Select between various static and animated background colors and patterns
    * Foreground Mode - Select between various static foreground colors and patterns
    * Single Color Mode - Select between various color options for devices that use the single color effect
    * Average Mode - Select between discrete bars (binning) or a smoothed line (low pass) output

# Command Line Options and Settings File

Keyboard Visualizer allows you to save your custom settings in two different ways.  You can pass parameters in on the command line (which is useful for creating shortcuts) or you can save a settings file in the same directory that the .exe is stored called settings.txt.  The parameters are as follows:

    Available command line commands:
        help              - Display this message and quit
        startminimized    - Start in system tray
    
    Available command line arguments:

    * WS28XX Pixel LED Strips
    
        - Arduino (Serial/USB-Serial) or ESP8266 (UDP over WiFi) may be used for controller
        - WS2812B, WS2811, and compatible LED strips/strings supported
        - Adjust the LEDs value in the Arduino sketch to match the number of LEDs on your LED strip/string
        - Recommended maximum of 90 or so LEDs on Arduino using 115200 baud rate
        - Configure LED strip using the ledstrip command line/settings file parameter
        - Number of LEDs in Arduino sketch must match num_leds parameter in LED command string
        - For serial connected LEDs, -ledstrip=port,baud,num_leds (ex. -ledstrip=COM1,115200,30)
        - For WiFi connected LEDs, -ledstrip=client,port,num_leds (ex. -ledstrip=192.168.1.5,1234,30)

        - For up to 200 LEDs on Arduino using 1000000 baud rate, see my pixel_controller repository
        - This requires AVR Studio 4 + WinAVR to build, but is more efficient by skipping Arduino IDE
